You'll find the detailed report and documentation of Nawabs' solution of the 'Absurd Agents' PS here!

<h2>The Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Implement a server that allows people to play word games like
Wordle, its variants, and Hangman. Details are left to your
imagination, but there should be a feature to let us use our dictionary.</li>
<li>For each game in your service, implement agents that play the game
optimally, mentioning the rationale behind your choice of algorithms
in the report. Rule of thumb, more stats == more marks. </li>
</ol>
